# P422 Project

My project proposal is to build a to-do list web app. This app would take data from the user with fields such as date, activity, time, etc. and store them in the MongoDB database. The client have the ability to add, update, delete, or cross off tasks. Four interactive views for the to-do list app would be:

* A list view where the client can add things to do
* A calendar view that displays to-do list items, where the client can click a date to see more information
* A list view that would display to-do items in order, could possibly be filtered by order of importance
* A “work mode” productivity timer that the client can use to time tasks or schedule breaks when working
